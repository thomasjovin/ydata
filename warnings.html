</strong>    TOTAL: 14 warning(s)
    <strong>Priority 1</strong>: 2 warning(s)
    <strong>Priority 2</strong>: 5 warning(s)

<strong>Priority 1 - heavy impact expected:
</strong><strong>*</strong>   * [LABELS - TEST NORMALITY]
  The label distribution failed to pass a normality test as-is and following a
  battery of transforms.
  It is possible that the data originates from an exotic distribution, there is
  heavy outlier presence or it is multimodal. Addressing this issue might prove
  critical for regressor performance.
<strong>*</strong>   * [DUPLICATES - DUPLICATE COLUMNS] Found 1 columns with exactly the same
  feature values as other columns.

<strong>Priority 2 - usage allowed, limited human intelligibility:
</strong><strong>*</strong>   * [DATA RELATIONS - HIGH COLLINEARITY - NUMERICAL] Found 4 numerical variables
  with high Variance Inflation Factor (VIF>5.0). The variables listed in results
  are highly collinear with other variables in the dataset. These will make
  model explainability harder and potentially give way to issues like
  overfitting.Depending on your end goal you might want to remove the highest
  VIF variables.
<strong>*</strong>   * [DATA RELATIONS - HIGH COLLINEARITY - CATEGORICAL] Found 3 categorical
  variables with significant collinearity (p-value < 0.05). The variables listed
  in results are highly collinear with other variables in the dataset and sorted
  descending according to propensity. These will make model explainability
  harder and potentially give way to issues like overfitting.Depending on your
  end goal you might want to remove variables following the provided order.
<strong>*</strong>   * [LABELS - OUTLIER DETECTION]
  Found 2 potential outliers across the full dataset.                     A
  distance bigger than 3.0 standard deviations of intra-cluster distances
  to the respective centroids was used to define the potential outliers.
<strong>*</strong>   * [BIAS&FAIRNESS - PROXY IDENTIFICATION] Found 5 feature pairs of correlation
  to sensitive attributes with values higher than defined threshold (0.5).
<strong>*</strong>   * [DUPLICATES - EXACT DUPLICATES] Found 20 instances with exact duplicate
  feature values.
